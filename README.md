The goal of this app is to gather people together to comment and rate the most popular movies/shows and to make popular lists. It will  use Trakt API to gather the movies/shows  and etc.

## What problem does this solve ? 

The idea behind this is to make a Reddit similar environment with a more visual appearance. To help people get more insights on opinions, more space to discuss and get customized recommendations. Trakt kind of solves this solution. But I would like to keep a simpler appearance and more focused on user-friendliness.

## Goals
- Users can scroll through lists made by other users 
- Users can comment and give ratings to movies/shows
- Users will have a personal account with their favorite movies/shows and friends etc.
- I am open to add functionality to this.

## Technical breakdown
I would like to use React/Next.js/Typescript for the Frontend. 
Node.js/Express for the Backend.
MongoDB or SQLite for the database.
