The goal of this app is to gather people together to comment and rate the most popular movies/tvShows, to make popular lists. It will the use trakt API to gather the movies/tvShows and etc.

# What problem does this solve ? 

The idea behind this is to make a reddit similar enviorment with a more visual apperance. To help people get more insights on opinions, more space to discuss and get customaized reccomendations. Trakt kind of solves this solution. But i would like to keep a more simplier apperance and more focused on userfriendsness.

# Goals
- Users can scroll through lists made by other users 
- Users can comment and give ratings to movies/shows
- Users will have a personal account with their favorite movies/shows and friends etc.
- I am open to add functionality to this.

# Technical breakdown
I would like to use React/NextJS/Typescript for the Frontend. 
NodeJS/Express for the Backend.
MongoDB or Sqllite for a database.
